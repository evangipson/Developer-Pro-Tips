## Git/github tips
- To create a new branch, use "git checkout -b new_branch_name" when on an up-to-date master.
- Review your "git status" and "git diff" to review your changes before committing to make sure there is no unexpected spacing or semantic errors.
- When writing a "git commit" message, make sure to keep it imperative and under 50 characters.
  - Remember that the description doesn't have a character limit! If you need to explain something, do it in the description and keep the commit message imperative!
  - Use the [seven rules of git committing](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) if you don't know how to name your commit.
- You can switch to the previous branch you were on by using the shortcut "git checkout -"
- You can reword your previous commit message by using the command "git commit -v --amend"
- Use "git stash" to save changes that aren't currently committed without committing.
  - "git stash list" will show you all current stashes saved.
  - "git stash apply <n>" will retreive the nth stash.
  - "git stash pop" apply the last stash, and remove it from the stash list.
  - "git stash clear" will remove all stashes.
- If a file is persisting to be modified even after a checkout, try to remove your git cache by running the command "git rm --cached -r ." in the root directory.
  - After the git rm you will have to reset your branch to the HEAD by running "git reset --hard"
- If you need to use code hosted on github, you should use [rawgit](http://rawgit.com/) to build your ```<script src``` urls.
  - Old way: ```<script src="https://github.com/user/repo/branch/file"></script>```
  - New, better way: ```<script src="http://rawgit.com/user/repo/branch/file"></script>```
  - An even better way: ```<script src="http://cdn.rawgit.com/user/repo/release/file"></script>```
    - *Note this needs a release, not a branch*
