## Algorithm tips
- *Algorithms* are guaranteed to be correct, *heuristics* may do a good job but don't provide any guarentee.
  - Heuristics are critical to developing algorithms.
- Reasonable-looking algorithms can easily be incorrect.
  - Algorithm correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.
- The heart of any algorithm is an idea. Clarity should be the goal.
